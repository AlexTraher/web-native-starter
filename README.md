# Web Starter
A minimalist starter to help learn web development.

See the blog post this is supported by [here](<LINK>)


## Getting started

1. Clone this repo
2. run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. run `npm start` to kick off the webpack dev server
4. visit the running app on `localhost:8080` in your browser
5. try making some changes and build out your own application! (some classic examples are a todo app, or a receipe search app)

## Where do I actually make changes though?
To help the learning process, there's 3 emoji's to look out for across these example apps:

ðŸªµ - shown where we change the _structure_ of our application "I need a new button"
ðŸŽ¨ - shown where we change _styles_ of our application "I need my button to be blue"
ðŸ¤– - shown where we change the _functionality_ of our application "I need my button to increment a counter"
